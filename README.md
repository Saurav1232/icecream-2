# icecream-2
Add an optional max_depth configuration option to IceCream that limits how deeply nested data structures are rendered in ic() output. The default behavior should remain unchanged. The option should apply consistently across ic() and ic.format(), and include tests covering nested dicts, lists, and custom objects.
